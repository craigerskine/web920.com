In this talk we'll discuss the history of **web accessibility**, including how it started, why it's important (**ADA Compliance**), and the responsibility of designers and developers to make websites and applications accessible for those with disabilities. Access to the Internet is no longer just a luxury, but a necessary fundamental human right.
